#+title: Notes

* Tasks
** DONE basic configuration traits
** DONE optional feature to enable http requests
** TODO implement default debug trait for Configurable
** TODO healthcheck
- [X] internet
- [ ] proxy with httpbin
- [ ] optional redis
- [ ] optional mongodb
- [ ] optional postgres
** DONE generic executor
- [X] basic version
- [X] tests for basic version
- [X] example for basic version
- [X] make in example in `examples/` folder
- [X] remove E from Task type, use string representation instead
- [X] in-memory backend for Tasks storage
- [X] split storage trait into separate module

* Notes
** httpbin could be launched as container "docker run -p 80:80 kennethreitz/httpbin"
** That's the plan:
///  1. **Task Creation:**
/// When a new task is created, it gets a unique `task_id` (this could be
/// a UUID or some other unique value). The task is serialized and stored
/// in a hashmap with the `task_id` as the key. The `task_id` is also
/// pushed to a list which acts as a task queue.
///
/// 2. **Task Execution:**
/// Workers pop `task_id` values from the task queue (the list data structure).
/// They then retrieve the corresponding serialized Task from the
/// hashmap using the `task_id`, deserialize the Task and start executing it.
///
/// 3. **Task Status Update:**
/// As a Task is being processed, its status is updated (started, finished,
/// retries, failed_with, etc.) and the updated Task is serialized and stored back
/// in the Redis hashmap. This allows the status of the Task to be tracked
/// in real-time.
///
/// 4. **Task Completion:**
/// When a Task is completed, its final status is updated in the hashmap.
/// If the task needs to be removed from storage after completion, it can be
/// deleted from the hashmap.
///
/// 5. **Task Failure and Retry:**
/// If a task fails, its `failed_with` field is set with the error,
/// `retries` is incremented, and it's pushed back into the storage list
/// for reprocessing by a worker.
